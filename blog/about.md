The world is not in a good place, and neither are my thoughts about it.
Bringing my thoughts to paper is my way of understanding what is happening
around me.  What we are living through is not ordinary, and it is darker than I
ever expected to put into words.

This is also not a diary as much as it should be seen as a commonplace book.
It's fragments, reflections and observations of the day.
