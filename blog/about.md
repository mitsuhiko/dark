# About

The world is not in a happy place and neither are my thoughts on society.  I'm
am not be much of a writer, but bringing my thoughts to paper is my way of
understanding and working with the world around me.  Since what is happening
right now is far from the ordinary, and far darker than what I thought I would
write about, I created this other space to share my thoughts.

This is also not a diary as much as it should be seen as a commonplace book.  It
contains whatever was on my mind, but specifically to understand the times we
are in.
