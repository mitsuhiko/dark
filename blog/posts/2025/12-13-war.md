# War

In December of 2021 I wrote a note in my journal: "write a short story about a
man buying a car on the eve of war."  I had been listening to the news. US
intelligence reports were warning about a possible invasion Russian invasion of
Ukraine. It sounded distant, abstract and implausible.  The invasion would not
happen for another few months, but my mind was occupied with the thoughts of
war and its consequences and the notion of the absurdity of making long-term
plans while something catastrophic was visibly assembling in the background.

Until the moment when the first bombs dropped, life continued as normal.  I did
not think much of my note, but I did think back about it a few times since. That
note felt like a quiet indictment: the world was offering all the signals, and
we were still behaving as if nothing fundamental could break.  We're in year
three of the war, and the war is now the new normal.  Except the discourse got
worse and worse.

I read Stefan Zweig's *The World of Yesterday* once more.  It is his memoir of
Europe before and between the wars.  Zweig describes a Vienna confident in
progress, convinced that tolerance, trade, and culture had made war obsolete.
What gives the book its power is not hindsight, but how sincere that belief was.
His world did not feel fragile to the people living in it — until it all came
crashing down.  The book contrasts the time and freedom of the author before the
wars with the horrors that followed.

The book sadly is quite eerie to read in 2025 and map it to current events. Who
wants a war?  Who can think of a war?  Yet the rhetoric of war was there, in
December of 2021, and it became real in February of 2022.  Kyiv as a city has
meaning to us.  My wife's and my first real date was there.  We have a map of
the city hanging in our living room.

The war itself is distant, but I am reminded of it every day. Ukrainian license
plates are commonplace in Vienna, my kids go to kindergarten and school with
Ukrainian refugees.  The news shows fires, explosions, destruction — every day.
We learned about deaths of distance acquaintances, we know of sons and fathers
who are prevented from leaving the country.

Sadly it seems that this year, something else has shifted.  The tone is no longer that of a
war that must be stopped.  The discourse has hardened, simplified.
Perhaps not only because of Ukraine, but unmistakably alongside, we seem to be
losing the liberal order many of us assumed was stable.  Realpolitik has
returned with a vengeance.  The aggressor is no longer clearly framed as the
problem.  For me worst of all, Europe's perceived ally, the United States, is
itself falling victim to authoritarian tendencies.

I grew up with a naive belief in peace and cooperation between nations.  Into
the project of the European Union which can bridge division and ignorance.
Sadly, it progressively looks like there was not much that supported that
belief.  The signs of disturbance were there years ago, but their dramatic
effects and fast acceleration were not clear to me.

Who wants a war?  The tone in news and on social media couldn't be more binary.
New lines are drawn and sides are taken.  Allies of half a century are now
becoming enemies.  For minerals, energy and data, new alliances are being formed
and old ones broken.  The US and Europe are no longer on the same side.  The US
would rather see Europe splintered into small pieces to have one fewer rival to
deal with.

What unsettles the most is that this shift is no longer confined to one theater
or one aggressor.  The war in Gaza, the bombing of Iran, the eruption of yet
another conflict in Venezuela — taken individually, each is explained away.
Taken together, they read differently.  They suggest a world in which force is
once again a legitimate first resort, and where legal and moral constraints are
treated as optional depending on who acts.  The language used to justify these
actions has changed completely.  It is no longer evasive or apologetic; it is
openly authoritarian. Nothing is hidden anymore.  Civilian deaths are brushed
aside as inevitable.  Online discourse argues them away as the product of AI
image manipulation.  International law lost any meaning.  

Reading Zweig is unsettling because it reminds you how quickly confidence
dissolves — and how late it is usually recognized as confidence at all.  His
tragedy was not blindness, but trust in continuity.  The possibility that the
war spreads no longer feels like paranoia; it feels like something that would
once again be described as "unthinkable" until it isn't.
