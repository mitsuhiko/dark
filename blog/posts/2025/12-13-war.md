# War

In December of 2021 I wrote down a note into my journal: “write a short story
about a man buying a car in the eve of a war.”  I was listening to the news and
there were reports of a possible invasion of Ukraine by Russia.  It sounded
distant at the time, and it would not take place for another few months, but my
mind could not think anymore of what an invasion would look like.  The absurdity
of making long term plans, while a war was looming.

All of it felt surreal, long before it took place.  Sometime after, I bought
myself a new copy of Stefan Zweig's *The World of Yesterday*, a memoir of
pre-war and between-the-wars Europe.  The book paints a Vienna before the wars,
with a growing sense of impending doom and it contrasts the time and freedom of
the author before the wars with the horrors that followed.

It's hard for me not to feel the feelings that reading his book evoked in me and
to relate to present times.  Who wants a war? Who can think of a war?  Yet the
rhetoric of war was there, in December of 2021, and it became real in February
of 2022.  It still feels surreal to me.  Kyiv as a city has meaning to us.  My
wife's and my first real date was there and we have a map of the city hanging in
our living room alongside Vienna, Yekaterinburg and London.  Cities that had
meaning to us.

The war itself is distant to me but you are reminded of it every day.  Ukrainian
cars in the city, pictures of fires, explosions and destruction are on the news
every day.  Yet at the same time, the tone no longer is the tone of a war that
needs to be stopped.  It has dramatically shifted.

We're leaving the liberal world order behind.  The aggressor is no longer seen
as the one that needs to be stopped.  Realpolitik is back with a vengeance and
Europe's perceived ally, the United States, is itself falling victim to
authoritarian tendencies.

I grew up with a naive belief in peace and cooperation between nations and sadly
it progressively looks like that there was not a lot that supported that belief.
The signs of disturbance were there years ago, but the dramatic effects they
would have were not clear to me.

Who wants a war?  The tone in news and on social media couldn't be more binary.
New lines are drawn and sides are taken.  Allies of half a century are now
becoming enemies.  For minerals, energy and data new alliances are being formed
and old ones are being broken.  The US and Europe are no longer on the same
side and the US would rather see Europe splintered into small pieces to have one
fewer rival to deal with.
