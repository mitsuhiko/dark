Borders are a curious thing.  They can be physical or invisible, but they almost
immediately have an effect.  Nowadays most borders surround countries, but not
exclusively so.

I personally have a strong aversion to borders.  There is a road in Vienna
called Ketzergasse (Heresy Lane).  Except it's not really a road in Vienna — one
side is Lower Austria, the other is Vienna.  They are both in the same country,
but depending on which side you are on, different parking rules apply, different
local taxes, different garbage collection rules.  The side of the street you
live on determines which Kindergarten or school your child can attend.
Thankfully, nowadays these are all minor inconveniences.  But the days when we
had physical gates between cities and countryside, gates that closed at night,
are only a few hundred years behind us.

The moment a border has been placed, it creates opportunity for those who want
to exploit it.  It always fascinates me how quickly the mere existence of a
border not only creates forces that want to take advantage of it, but also how
little time it takes for people to become supportive of it.  Once we are used to
a border, there will be those of us who want it to remain.  The longer it
exists, the larger the differences on either side grow, and the more some will
want to retain it.

It requires some external shock to remove a border again.  The borders between
cities in German-speaking Europe and the surrounding countryside were not just
administrative lines determining who could live where; they were physical walls.
Crossing with goods meant paying customs duties.  Living within the walls for a
year and a day made you a free citizen, whereas living outside made you a serf
to the local lord.

My childhood was defined by borders coming down.  Where once we had to show
passports to unfriendly border control guards to cross the mountains into Italy,
suddenly we could just drive across without any checks.  The borders between
European countries became less and less relevant.  Gradually, that also meant
more and more workers in the service industry came from all across the Union.

People are drawn to borders.  All your frustrations and disappointments in life
can be projected onto the "other side."  And if a border has friction to pass,
it inspires some to cross it.

The division between East and West Germany was one of the most extreme examples.
There was very little that divided those parts of Germany from one another.
They spoke the same language, and prior to the Cold War, they were not even
along typical historical divisions.  Yet the border was guarded, militarized,
and divided a growing economy from an increasingly failing one.  The existence
of that border created competition through different economic systems, and
ultimately a desire to escape from one side to the other.

The stories of that border are numerous and harrowing.  People dug tunnels,
built hot air balloons, hid in trucks, and swam across rivers to escape from
East to West Germany.  Many died trying. When you hear stories of families
crossing with their children, knowing they might die in the attempt, it is hard
to imagine the desperation that must have driven them.

And it never ended.  It's just easier to defend the existence of a border when
it keeps those out that you don't understand — those who don't share your
culture, your customs, your language.

Getting rid of borders is unpopular right now.  Not only are we putting borders
up, we're also trying to put people back on the other side if we can.  Some call
it remigration, but really, the destination does not matter as long as it's not
within that one's border.  No story exemplifies this more than the [deportation
of Kilmar Abrego
Garcia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation_of_Kilmar_Abrego_Garcia).  The
US government tried and proposed multiple destination countries for him, none of
which he had any connection to.

Being on the better side of the border is a privilege, and it feels good.
Wanting to get rid of the border is natural for those on the worse side.
Defending the removal of the border by those who benefit from it is unpopular.
In fact, it can be seen as irresponsible, even treasonous.  Yet without that
border, both sides would be better off as commerce and culture would flow more
freely.

Nowadays it sounds ridiculous that people once lost their lives on a warm summer
day because they did not make it back into the city before the gates closed, and
army guards shot at them to enforce the border.  Yet that event was once nothing
more than a small note in a newspaper.  I hope that one day society will look
back at the enforcement of present-day borders with the same incredulity.
